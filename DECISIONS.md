# Decisions

Short decision log for architecture choices. Publicly and internally, this is
the Axiom Rules Engine; the Rust crate and executable are `axiom-rules`. One
entry per decision, most recent first.

## 2026-04-25 — RuleSpec is the only external programme format

**Decision.** The canonical authoring and interchange surface is RuleSpec
YAML/JSON: structured rule metadata with concise formula strings. Authoring
tools write RuleSpec, the Axiom app visualises RuleSpec and compiled traces, and
the Rust engine normalises RuleSpec into `ProgramSpec` before compilation.

`ProgramSpec` is the engine IR, not the author schema. It remains useful inside
compiled artifacts and tests, but programme files accepted by the compile path
must be explicit RuleSpec (`format: rulespec/v1` or `schema: axiom.rules.*`).

**Why.**

- Machine authors need an unambiguous, schema-valid target more than a
  hand-written DSL.
- The Axiom app can provide human visualisers for rule graphs, provenance, and traces,
  so raw source readability is secondary to faithful generation and validation.
- A structured schema can represent provenance, source-document anchors,
  jurisdiction/repo ownership, temporal versions, rule kind, relation
  orientation, and future hard gaps without overloading expression syntax.
- Concise formula strings keep common calculations compact while the surrounding
  YAML/JSON keeps metadata machine-checkable.

**Consequences.**

- `axiom-rules compile` accepts RuleSpec YAML only.
- Ambiguous YAML with a top-level `rules:` key and no discriminator is rejected.
- The formula parser is an internal implementation module for RuleSpec formula
  fields, not a separate programme format.
- Old experiments should be recovered from Git history, not preserved in active
  code.

## 2026-04-25 — Jurisdiction repo paths are canonical IDs

**Decision.** Production rule content lives in jurisdiction repositories using
the same top-level taxonomy in every repo:

- `statute/`
- `regulation/`
- `policy/`
- `sources/`

The canonical rule ID is the filepath, not an `id:` field:

- `us:statute/7/2014/e/6/A`
- `us-tn:policy/dhs/snap/manual/23/L`

Rule files use the legal-unit stem, with companion tests beside them:

- `statute/7/2014/e/6/A.yaml`
- `statute/7/2014/e/6/A.test.yaml`

`sources/` mirrors the root rule tree and stores source-registry metadata. The
registry path also defines identity; remove the `sources/` prefix when deriving
the source ID. R2 object paths are deterministic from repo + relative source
path, so source registry files do not include `storage:` or `id:` by default.
They do include expected hashes in Git.

**Why.**

- Filepaths are already the reviewable, mergeable namespace.
- Explicit IDs and storage paths create drift risk when they repeat the path.
- Git needs expected hashes to prove which exact source artifacts a rule was
  reviewed against; R2 metadata only tells us what is stored now.
- Mirroring `sources/` to `statute/`, `regulation/`, and `policy/` gives simple
  path-addressable joins between source material and executable rules.

**Consequences.**

- Source registry files default to metadata and hashes:
  `publisher`, `canonical_url`, `retrieved_at`, and `hashes`.
- Explicit `artifacts:` metadata is reserved for exceptions such as multiple
  files, nonstandard artifact names, page ranges, historical snapshots,
  alternate official URLs, or curated OCR/AKN corrections.
- Jurisdiction repos should use legal-unit paths like
  `policy/dhs/snap/manual/23/L.yaml`.
- See `docs/jurisdiction-repos.md` for the concrete layout.

## 2026-04-19 — `programmes/` migrates to jurisdiction repos

**Decision.** The `programmes/` directory in this engine repo is a proof of
concept. In production, encodings live in the jurisdiction repo they belong to.
Canonical jurisdiction repositories use `statute/`, `regulation/`, `policy/`,
and `sources/` paths.

The engine resolves `extends:` by filesystem path; any mounted layout works.

**Why.**

- Keeps the engine repo focused on runtime and schema, not content.
- Per-jurisdiction repos have their own release cadence, reviewers, and license
  boundaries.

**Consequences.**

- The programmes currently under `programmes/` in this repo move out
  post-prototype.
- The engine can keep a small set of canonical examples for tests and docs.

## 2026-04-19 — `sets` and `amends` are graph-level metadata

**Decision.** State-delegation (`sets`) and regulation-amends-statute
(`amends`) edges stay in source/provenance graph metadata, not inside executable
RuleSpec formulas. The engine reads merged RuleSpec / `ProgramSpec`; graph-level
facts are consumed by validators, the Axiom app, and trace renderers.

**Why.**

- Overloading executable rules with graph metadata makes them harder to diff and
  harder to review.
- Multi-source citations on a derived output are an engine feature, but they are
  not the same thing as graph-level `sets` / `amends` edges.

**Consequences.**

- No engine execution change is required for `sets` / `amends`.
- A follow-up can teach explain traces to pull graph metadata for rendering.
- The `source` / `source_url` fields on derived outputs should become arrays to
  support multi-document provenance.
